      horizon contacts - Create and manage Horizon contacts

    SYNOPSIS
      horizon contacts

    DESCRIPTION

      'horizon contacts add' adds a new contact for usage with Horizon.
      An address for the send channel will be immediately created. This address
      consists of an IPNS hash and can be shared with the contact to allow
      them to receive files from you.
      The contact should run the same procedure on their side and provide you
      with the address of their shared list.
      This becomes the receive-address which you can set manually later using
      'horizon contacts set-receive-addr <name> <receive-address>'

        > horizon contacts add mmusterman
        🤝 Send address: QmSomeSendHash
        > horizon contacts set-rcv-addr mmusterman QmSomeReceiveHash

      Where did the recieve address come from? The other contact ran
      'horizon contacts info <name>' and provided you with their send address.
      You should do the same, providing them with your send address. Your send
      address becomes their receive address for you.

      'horizon contacts info <name>' prints a given contact to the screen,
      showing the current values for the send address and receive address.

        > horizon contacts info mmusterman
        mmusterman
        🤝 Send address:     QmSomeHash
        🤝 Receive address:  QmSomeHash
        🔑 IPFS keypair:     com-semantical.horizon.mmusterman

        joe
        🤝 Send address:     QmSomeHash
        🤝 Receive address:  QmSomeHash
        🔑 IPFS keypair:     com-semantical.horizon.joe

      'horizon contacts ls' lists the available contacts.

        > horizon contacts ls
        joe
        mmusterman

      'horizon contacts rm <name>' removes a given contact from Horizon.
      All files shared with the contact until this point remain available to
      the contact.

        > horizon contacts rm mmusterman

      'horizon contacts rename <name> <new-name>' renames a given contact
      but otherwise keeps all information and addresses the same.

        > horizon contacts rename mmusterman max

      'horizon contacts set-rcv-addr <name> <hash>' sets the receive address
      for a given contact. The contact should provide you with this address –
      the result of them adding you as a contact to their horizon instance.

        > horizon contacts set-rcv-addr mmusterman QmSomeHash
