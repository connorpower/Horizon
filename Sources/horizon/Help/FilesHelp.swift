    USAGE
      horizon files - Manipulate files in horizon.

    SYNOPSIS
      horizon files

    DESCRIPTION

      'horizon files add' adds a new file to be shared with a contact.
      The file will be added to IPFS. The list of files shared with the
      contacted will be updated and in turn also re-published to IPFS.

        > horizon shares add mmusterman "./The Byzantine Generals Problem.pdf"

      'horizon shares rm <contact-name> <file>' unshares a file with
      the given contact, and if the file is shared with no other contacts
      - removes the file from IPFS.

      Note that unsharing a file is not a security mechanism. There is no
      guarantee that your contact will receive the updated file list sans
      the removed file, or that the contact could not simply access the file
      via its direct IPFS hash.

        > horizon shares rm QmSomeHash

      'horizon files ls [<contact>]' lists all files which you have
      sent or received, optionally restricted to a single contact.

      You may optionally filter by only a given contact.

      'horizon files cat <hash>' outputs the contents of a file to the
      command line. Care should be taken with binary files, as the shell may
      interpret byte sequences in unpredictable ways. This command is most
      useful when combined with a pipe.

        > horizon files cat QmSomeHash | gzip > received_file.gzip

      'horizon files cp <target-file>' copies the contents of a file to a
      location on the local machine. If <target-file> is a directory,
      the actual file will be written with it's Horizon name inside the directory.
      The following command would copy a file from Horizon onto your desktop.

        > horizon files cp QmSomeHash ~/Desktop

      SUBCOMMANDS
        horizon files help                        - Displays detailed help information
        horizon files share <contact> <file>      - Adds a new file to be shared with a contact
        horizon files unshare <contact> <file>    - Unshares a file which was shared with a contact
        horizon files ls [<contact>]              - Lists all files (optionally filtered by a given contact)
        horizon files cat <hash>                  - Outputs the contents of a file to the command line
        horizon files cp <hash> <target-file>     - Copies a file to a location on the local machine
