/**
 The CLI program has multiple top level commands, for instance:

     $ horizon-cli sync
     $ horizon-cli peers list
     $ horizon-cli share "Max Mustermann" ~/Desktop/The\ Cathedral\ and\ the\ Bazaar.pdf

 In these examples above, there are three top level commands: `sync`,
 `peers` and `share`. Each top level command has its own Handler which
 is repsonsible for processing the command.

 ## Examples

 Sync:

     $ horizon-cli sync
     Handler -> SyncHandler
     args -> []

 Peers:

     $ horizon-cli peers list
     Handler -> PeersHandler
     args -> ["list"]

 Share:

     $ horizon-cli share "Max Mustermann" ~/Desktop/The\ Cathedral\ and\ the\ Bazaar.pdf
     Handler -> ShareHandler
     args -> ["Max Mustermann", "~/Desktop/The Cathedral and the Bazaar.pdf"]
